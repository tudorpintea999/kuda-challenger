# KUDA Challenger

Challenger for the Karak Universal Data Availability (KUDA) DSS.
It polls the aggregator for DA tasks that have passed the challenge period time and submits a challenge to the KUDA contract if the data is not available or incorrect, according to the commitment.
Provers can counter-challenge the challenger by submitting a proof that the data is available and correct.

**Note:** There is an associated bond that the challenger must deposit in order to submit a challenge. This bond is returned if the challenge is successful, but is forfeited if the challenge is unsuccessful.
